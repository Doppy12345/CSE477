# CSE477 Web Developement
CSE 477 was focused on web developement utilizing technologies such as Flask, MySQL, and docker.
The main assignment of the semester was what could be used as a portfolio website including several key features such as realtime chat, a resume that pulled from a mySQL database, and a feedback page, and a simple authentication system.  The [application](https://homework-fjzggzgsba-uc.a.run.app) is hosted on google cloud platform.

The Second application was the final exam where it was required to implement a simplified kanban board following trello as a guideline. The application contains a simple authentication system, the ability to create new boards and invite users to those boards. Create new tasks, and edit tasks along with moving them to different states (TODO, Work in Progress, Done). Each board also contains an all member realtime chat.
